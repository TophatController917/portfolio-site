      <p>Hello! I'm Beckett, a gameplay programmer. I'm currently majoring in Games and Interactive Media at Michigan State University, a program that has  ranked in the top 10 of game development programs in the country for  over seven years. I’m proud to have made the Dean's List for each of my  first three semesters at MSU and intend to continue that success.  I  have taken several classes in game programming and design, and created  several projects, some of which are showcased on this site. I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science to ensure I develop a broad range of programming skills. </p>
      <p>Outside of class, I'm a member of MSU's professional game development fraternity Gamma Iota Mu, the very first professional fraternity for game development in the country! I've also taken part in several game jams, as well as longer projects working in MSU's Spartasoft Studio. </p>
      <p>It will come as no surprise to hear that I greatly enjoy game development; I love the teamwork, the creativity, the puzzle-solving experience of programming, and the enormous potential for storytelling that game development provides. My dream is to create video games like the ones I love and spur that same passion in the people who play them!</p>
      <p>When I’m not working on a project, I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons, hanging out with my friends, walking through nature, reading good books, and of course, playing video games. Some of my favorites are Super Mario Galaxy, Elden Ring and Fire Emblem Three houses.</p>
