        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Cycle//Break is a roguelike deck builder where the player must manage resources called Cycles and upgrade a deck of cards as they fight their way through a gauntlet of enemies to escape cyberspace.</p>
        <p>I was the project’s gameplay and systems programmer, creating a modular, designer-friendly card framework and programming the core card battle gameplay loop. I also advised the design team and helped make critical decisions on game direction.</p>

          <h3>Created the Card Framework</h3>
            <p>I collaborated with my fellow programmer to create a card framework that allowed for easy scalability using a SQLite database. I also ensured the framework was as modular as possible in order to grant designers plenty of creative freedom.</p>
            <p>By building a simple, reusable card shell, I was able to craft all the tools our designers needed to create interesting cards and customize player and enemy decks.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, because our approach was designed with scalability in mind from the start, we could easily store the cards for designers to test and tweak as they pleased.</p>

          <h3>New Input System</h3>
          <p>In addition to programming the liquid state abilities, I also helped to implement Unity's new input system. This included reworking various scripts to function using the new input system while maintaining the same behavior and being designer-friendly.</p>
          <p>In particular, I developed functionality to allow the player to switch between different control schemes in real time, without needing to pause the game and access a menu to change control schemes. When using the pressure launch, for example, the player can freely switch between using the mouse and the WASD keys to aim.</p>

          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>With such a large group of people, it was essential for all of the different teams to communicate effectively with one another. To that end, I kept in regular contact with the other members of the programming team, and met with them in-person weekly to discuss the project progress.</p>
          <p>In addition, I met with members of other teams to ensure that teams were communicating between each other cohesively. In particular, I spoke with the design team to ensure alignment between the design and development teams so that our programs were effective and easy to understand.</p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>This was my first time working on a larger team, and it was also my first time working on a project of such size. It was a rewarding experience, and took away two key lessons.</p>
        <section class="contribution-subblock">
          <div class="text-container">
            <h4>Interdisciplinary Cohesion</h4>
            <p>Early on while working on this project, communication struggled because everyone was separated into teams. For the first few weeks, several programmers didn't have anything to do because we didn't know enough about what the design team wanted from us.</p>
            <p>One thing I struggled with, however, was maintaining communication when I wasn't actively working. When I came back to work, I needed to get caught up on what I missed before I could start working again. In order to address this, I checked in with my teammates to stay up-to-date.</p>
            <p>This project taught me how communication goes beyond just what happens while I'm working, something I have kept in mind since.</p>

            <h4>Test, Iterate and Improve</h4>
            <p>In most of the projects I worked on prior to Goose Genie, time limitations restricted my ability to refine the game. As a result, my usual approach to development was more focused on getting something to work than making it the best it could be. While there is a time and place for that approach, iteration creates a superior end product.</p>
            <p>With Goose Genie, I spent more time improving my work. I tested things myself, asked my peers for their thoughts, and iterated on my work to create the best version of the project.</p>
            <p>Iteration is an essential part of game development, and Goose Genie provided me with an opportunity to hone my skills in doing so.</p>
