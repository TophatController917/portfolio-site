        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Cycle//Break is a roguelike deck builder where the player must manage resources called Cycles and upgrade a deck of cards as they fight their way through a gauntlet of enemies to escape cyberspace.</p>
        <p>I was the project’s gameplay and systems programmer, creating a modular, designer-friendly card framework and programming the core card battle gameplay loop. I also advised the design team and helped make critical decisions on game direction.</p>

          <h3>Created the Card Framework</h3>
            <p>I collaborated with my fellow programmer to create a card framework that allowed for easy scalability using a SQLite database. I also ensured the framework was as modular as possible in order to grant designers plenty of creative freedom.</p>
            <p>By building a simple, reusable card shell, I was able to craft all the tools our designers needed to create interesting cards and customize player and enemy decks.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, because our approach was designed with scalability in mind from the start, we could easily store the cards for designers to test and tweak as they pleased.</p>

          <h3>Core Gameplay Loop</h3>
          <p>In addition to creating the basic card framework, I created a modular card prefab that could be easily populated with card data, developed functionality to draw, play and discard cards, programmed the event logic for both the player and enemy's turns, and designed and implemented various features to ensure the best game feel.</p>
          <p>When developing the core gameplay loop, I rigorously tested the game event logic alongside designers to ensure information was clearly communicated to the player and the game flowed smoothly. I also created the inspect feature to allow players to look at cards more closely and make strategizing easier.</p>

          <h3>Design Collaboration</h3>
          <p>Throughout the development of Cycle//Break, I collaborated with designers to give them the tools they needed and maximize interdisciplinary cohesion. This included both regularly scheduled meetings and keeping consistent availability to help address issues, fix bugs, and discuss design decisions.</p>
          <p>I also advised the design team on a critical decision for game direction. Halfway through the project, it was clear to me that the amount of work we had remaining would have been too much for us to finish in the time we had. I wrote out the flaws I saw with our prototype and future plans, designed an alternative plan that would reuse the work we had already made and allow us to meet our deadline, and proposed it to the team. The team accepted the proposal and changed direction, and we were able to salvage the project.</p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>Cycle//Break was familiar territory for me in a lot of ways, which meant it was an excellent place to practice and hone my skills. Struggles later in development also taught me valuable lessons in problem solving.</p>

            <h4>Constant Improvements</h4>
            <p>Cycle//Break was very similar to previous projects I have worked on in terms of team size and composition, and project timeframe. Because of this familiarity, I was able to safely push myself into new skills while still being productive on the project.</p>
            <p>One example of how I did this was by collaborating with my fellow programmer to introduce myself to SQLite. As I am primarily a gameplay programmer, SQLite was something I had never interacted with before. This collaboration allowed me to learn new tools touse in future projects.</p>
            <p>I was also able to use this project as an opportunity to refine the knowledge I already had by making sure my code was as clean, readable, modular and designer-friendly as possible. I received several comments praising my work and thanking me for making everyone's jobs easy.</p>

            <h4>How to Tackle Difficult Problems</h4>
            <p>The biggest lessons I learned from Cycle//Break were in problem solving. Cycle//Break started out completely different from its current state, and it was only after a full directional pivot that the game became anything like what it is now.</p>
            <p>I was one of the two people who first brought attention to the flaws in the game's original concept, and I developed valuable communication, planning and problem-solving skills in the process.</p>
            <p>I also was able to get experience working on a game after a complete change in plans. My work after the team pivoted to a new direction taught me how to manage rapidly changing plans and tight deadlines, and how to adapt old work to meet new project needs.</p>
