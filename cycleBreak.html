        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Cycle//Break is a roguelike deck builder where the player must manage resources called Cycles and upgrade a deck of cards as they fight their way through a gauntlet of enemies to escape cyberspace.</p>
        <p>I was the project’s gameplay and systems programmer, creating a modular, designer-friendly card framework and programming the core card battle gameplay loop. I also advised the design team and helped make critical decisions on game direction.</p>

          <h3>Created the Card Framework</h3>
            <p>I collaborated with my fellow programmer to create a card framework that allowed for easy scalability using a SQLite database. I also ensured the framework was as modular as possible in order to grant designers plenty of creative freedom.</p>
            <p>By building a simple, reusable card shell, I was able to craft all the tools our designers needed to create interesting cards and customize player and enemy decks.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, because our approach was designed with scalability in mind from the start, we could easily store the cards for designers to test and tweak as they pleased.</p>

          <h3>Core Gameplay Loop</h3>
          <p>In addition to creating the basic card framework, I created a modular card prefab that could be easily populated with card data, developed functionality to draw, play and discard cards, programmed the event logic for both the player and enemy's turns, and designed and implemented various features to ensure the best game feel.</p>
          <p>When developing the core gameplay loop, I rigorously tested the game event logic alongside designers to ensure information was clearly communicated to the player and the game flowed smoothly. I also created the inspect feature to allow players to look at cards more closely and make strategizing easier.</p>

          <h3>Design Collaboration</h3>
          <p>Throughout the development of Cycle//Break, I collaborated with designers to give them the tools they needed and maximize interdisciplinary cohesion. This included both regularly scheduled meetings and keeping consistent availability to help address issues, fix bugs, and discuss design decisions.</p>
          <p>I also advised the design team on a critical decision for game direction. Halfway through the project, it was clear to me that the amount of work we had remaining would have been too much for us to finish in the time we had. I wrote out the flaws I saw with our prototype and future plans, designed an alternative plan that would reuse the work we had already made and allow us to meet our deadline, and proposed it to the team. The team accepted the proposal and changed direction, and we were able to salvage the project.</p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>This was my first time working on a larger team, and it was also my first time working on a project of such size. It was a rewarding experience, and took away two key lessons.</p>

          <div class="text-container">
            <h4>Interdisciplinary Cohesion</h4>
            <p>Early on while working on this project, communication struggled because everyone was separated into teams. For the first few weeks, several programmers didn't have anything to do because we didn't know enough about what the design team wanted from us.</p>
            <p>One thing I struggled with, however, was maintaining communication when I wasn't actively working. When I came back to work, I needed to get caught up on what I missed before I could start working again. In order to address this, I checked in with my teammates to stay up-to-date.</p>
            <p>This project taught me how communication goes beyond just what happens while I'm working, something I have kept in mind since.</p>

            <h4>Test, Iterate and Improve</h4>
            <p>In most of the projects I worked on prior to Goose Genie, time limitations restricted my ability to refine the game. As a result, my usual approach to development was more focused on getting something to work than making it the best it could be. While there is a time and place for that approach, iteration creates a superior end product.</p>
            <p>With Goose Genie, I spent more time improving my work. I tested things myself, asked my peers for their thoughts, and iterated on my work to create the best version of the project.</p>
            <p>Iteration is an essential part of game development, and Goose Genie provided me with an opportunity to hone my skills in doing so.</p>
